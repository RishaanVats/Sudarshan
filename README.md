Angular Frontend (Dashboard UI)
              │
              │ HTTP (REST)
              ▼
       Mock API (json-server)
              │
              ▼
           db.json
              │

# 🔌 API Integration

The frontend connects to a mock API (json-server):

Example:

```typescript
this.http.get('http://localhost:3000/volunteers');
```

---

# 🖥️ Development

Run development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

Generate components:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

Build project:

```bash
ng build
```

---

# 🧪 Testing

Run unit tests:

```bash
ng test
```

End-to-end testing can be configured as needed.
